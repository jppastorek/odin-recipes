This is a project to practice my html skills. Even though I have done a few html courses, it has been a while, so I am going to do this simple project to brush up. I have been working with simple things like the boilerplate, header tags, anchors, and images. I think one thing that I may have trouble with is linking relative paths with different folders. I will need to keep in mind the dot notation (one dot for file path, two dots to jump out of one folder and into another).

My idea is to pick a few of my favorite things to make for my family so that I can use this to share with the extended family and to document for my children and their children.
