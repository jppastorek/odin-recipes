    <h1>Chicken Andouille Gumbo</h1>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Everyone's mama's or grandma's gumbo is the best, and everyone's gumbo is different. This recipe is a mixture of a few different recipes I have learned over the years. I have included some key elements that take extra time for extra flavor, but you
        can always substitute for other store bought items for a quicker gumbo. This recipe usually takes me one whole day, or two depending on when I make the stock. It always tastes better on day two, so I highly recommend making it the day before you
        want to serve.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p><em>Makes about 2 gallons. Serves 12-15 people</em></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 yellow onions</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers</li>
        <li>4-5 stalks of celery</li>
        <li>lots of garlic</li>
        <li>stock (enough to fill the pot)</li>
        <li>1 cup oil</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups of flour</li>
        <li>2 lbs andouille (gotta be the good stuff from Laplace)</li>
        <li>2-3 lbs chicken (I like dark meat, but breasts are fine)</li>
        <li>worcestershire</li>
        <li>hot sauce</li>
        <li>bay leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) Prepare the stock - see stock recipe</li>
        <li>Chop all the vegetables and sausage</li>
        <li>Heat your pot to med-high heat and sear the sausage</li>
        <li>Remove sausage from the pot and add oil and flour</li>
        <li>Stir the roux so it doesn't burn. Stop at the color you desire. Darker rouxs have richer flavor</li>
        <li>Once your roux is good, add vegetables (minus garlic) and saute a few minutes</li>
        <li>Add garlic. Saute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add some stock so the roux doesn't burn.</li>
        <li>Add all your meat.</li>
        <li>Add more stock until desired consistency. The sweet spot is not too watery but not too thick.</li>
        <li>Add bay leaves, hot sauce, and worcestershire.</li>
        <li>Simmer 2-3 hours. If you added too much liquid, just simmer with top off.</li>
    </ol>
